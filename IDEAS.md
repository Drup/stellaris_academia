# Unimplemented ideas

- National edict to choose a focus
  On launching the edict, the player can choose one specialization (using an event with multiple choices).
  While the national edict is active, An event granting a scientist with this specialization can occur.

## Events

- Conference
  Should be on a specific topic(s) and on a specific planet
  Triggers:
  - Researching a pioneering tech
  - A scientists leveled up/death
  - A research station is built
  - "Just because"

  Choice:
  - Finance the conference
  - Do not finance the conference
  - Divert resources to another area of research

  Interaction with other events:
  - Asteroid (land on the scientists, killing an involved leader)

  Outcome (after a few years):
  - Science boost for the topic
  - Local science boost on the planet
  - False lead! Science malus
  - Creation of a new scientific leader

- Visiting foreign scientist
  Triggers:
  - Allied/science agreement with another civ with a leader that
    has a bonus on what you are researching
  - Something with vassals ?

  Choice:
  - Organize a focus group on his work (+science for current tech)
  - Make him give a series of talks on his work (+skill for our scientists)
  - Make him tour the scientific facilities (opinion bonus + science boost for the other civ)
  - Do not do anything
  - Offer the scientist a position (gain new scientist, opinion malus)
  - Refuse the scientist (opinion malus)
